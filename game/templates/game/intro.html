<p class="introText">
  The Virtual Testing Ag Performance Solutions (VTAPS) was developed by the
  University of Nebraska Extension and has been modeled around the highly
  successful UNL-TAPS (<a href="https://taps.unl.edu">taps.unl.edu</a>) program.
  In the TAPS program farmers and other participants make a series of management
  decisions as they respond to field, agronomic and technologically based
  information. At the end of the growing season, the TAPS participants see how
  they compare (rank) against other participants in terms of profitability,
  irrigation and nitrogen efficiency and crop yield. The TAPS program has helped
  participants in the self-realization of management changes that need to be
  improved, and participants have adopted new technology and management
  practices on their farming operation as a result of participating in TAPS.

<p class="introText">
  The VTAPS program was developed so that high school ag students, and others,
  could have a similar TAPS experience. VTAPS participants will select the
  hybrid and seeding rate they wish to plant. They will also be able to apply
  nitrogen fertilizer <em>(at $0.60 per pound)</em> for pre-plant
  <em>($8.50 application cost)</em>, sidedress
  <em>($8.50 application cost)</em> and five fertigation applications
  <em>($1.25 application cost/ac)</em>. Participants will also be able to apply
  irrigation water <em>($6.10 per acre inch)</em> twice during each week of the
  simulation <em>(maximum of 1.0 inches per application)</em>. Other costs such
  as machinery, materials, land taxes and opportunity costs amount to
  <em>$742.79</em>. Cost of production is calculated on a weekly basis and
  divided by the Farm Service Agency Annual Production History (APH) of 230
  bushes per acre. The location of the field is North Platte, NE in a corn
  soybean no-till crop rotation. The soil type is a Cozad Silt Loam soil, 2%
  organic matter and water holding capacity of 1.81 inches/ft. Average residual
  nitrogen at the beginning of the growing season is 20 pounds N per acre and
  85% initial soil water content.
</p>

<p class="introText">
  At the end of the simulation total cost is divided by the final yield. A
  complete budget is available at:
  <a href="https://taps.unl.edu/budget">taps.unl.edu/budget</a>. All the
  decisions and generated weather information are fed into a crop simulation
  model, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) and results
  are included in a weekly summary. Participants will also have soil moisture
  sensor information showing soil moisture at various depths of the soil
  profile.
</p>

<p class="introText">
  At the end of week 24 participants will be able to see their final yield, cost
  of production <em>($/bushel)</em> and nitrogen and irrigation efficiency
  <em
    >(Water × Nitrogen Intensification Performance Index – WNIPI, Lo et al.,
    2019)</em
  >. In a group simulation such as a crop production class, participants will
  see how they rank in these same categories, allowing them to self-realize what
  areas of their management decisions are the strongest and which ones could use
  some improvement. Participants will also be able to see how much nitrogen has
  potentially leached below the root zone. The single player version of VTAPS
  will allow participants to try to improve their yield, cost of production and
  nitrogen and irrigation application efficiency.

  The VTAPS program was developed by Alex Enersen under the guidance of Dr.
  Stephen Cooper, Executive Director at the J S Raikes School of Computer
  Science & Management at UNL. The results of the VTAPS program have been
  calibrated with six years of TAPS data from North Platte, NE by Rintu Sen and
  Dr. Saleh Taghvaeian from the UNL Biological Systems Engineering Department.
  The simulated weather data and weather forecasts have been developed by Dr.
  Matt Stockton, UNL Extension Economist at North Platte.
</p>

<p class="introText">
  A VTAPS curriculum has been developed for high school ag students to support
  educational efforts with the VTAPS computer program and is available upon
  request at taps@unl.edu . The curriculum has 15 lessons each on hybrid
  selection, nitrogen management and irrigation management.
